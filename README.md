# Proxy-model-with-Pseudopressure-function
The proxy equation relates the variables of wellhead pressure, reservoir pressure and WGR; to find an estimate of gas production.
This function compares the results of a normal proxy equation with a proxy equation with pseudopressure and determines which is better according to the case taking into account the R2 and RMSE.
