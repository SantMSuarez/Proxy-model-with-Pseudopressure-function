# Proxy-model-with-Pseudopressure-function
The proxy equation relates the variables of wellhead pressure, reservoir pressure and WGR; to find an estimate of gas production.
This function compares the results of a normal proxy equation with a proxy equation with pseudopressure and determines which is better according to the case taking into account the R2 and RMSE.

INPUT
You will need an Excel-type document with the following information:
Excel name: Well_GOR
The first column name "Well_name" writes the list of wells names.
Name the second column "GOR_ft3bbl" and write the GOR for each of the wells.
another Excel name: "INPUT_PROXY_ name" of the well in each case. An Excel must be made for each well with the information of WHP_psig in the first column, Pr_psia in the second column, WGR_STB_MMSCF in the third column and Qg_MMSCF in the fourth column.
